# CLAUDE.md — tayrax

Guidelines for working on this project. Read `docs/tayrax.md` for the full product plan.

---

## Project Overview

**tayrax** is a crypto monitoring and trading assistant PWA.
- Real-time price data via WebSocket (CoinCap, Binance)
- Background market data via REST (CoinGecko)
- No backend — runs entirely in the browser
- Hosted at `tayrax.github.io`

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Framework:** Svelte + Vite
- **App type:** PWA (Service Worker + Web App Manifest)
- **Styling:** plain CSS or CSS custom properties — no UI framework, no Tailwind

Note: `static/` is Vite's `publicDir`. All files here are served from the site
root (`/manifest.json`, `/sw.js`, `/tayrax-logo.svg`). Do not create a separate
`public/` directory — keep PWA assets and logos together in `static/`.

## Development Phases

The project is built incrementally. Do not implement features from a later phase until the current one is complete and stable.

1. **Phase 1 — Simple Alerts:** live prices + user-defined alert rules + browser notifications ✅ Complete
2. **Phase 2 — Technical Indicators:** OHLCV charts, RSI/SMA/MACD/Bollinger Bands, signal alerts ✅ Complete
3. **Phase 3 — Semi-Automatic Trading:** indicator-driven trade proposals logged to action log (Phase 3a ✅ Complete, no exchange required); exchange API integration + order execution (Phase 3b)
4. **Phase 4 — Fully Automatic Trading:** autonomous execution, paper trading mode, risk management

---

## APIs

| API | Usage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CoinCap WebSocket | Real-time prices | `wss://ws.coincap.io/prices?assets=...` |
| Binance WebSocket | Candlesticks, order book | `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/...` |
| CoinGecko REST | Asset list, market cap, history | 50 req/min on free key |

- Both CoinCap and Binance allow direct browser requests (CORS is open for public endpoints)
- No proxy or backend needed for public market data
- For Phase 3+, exchange API keys must **never** be hardcoded or committed to git

---

## Asset Configuration

`SUPPORTED_ASSETS` in `config.ts` is the static compile-time registry of all coins the app knows about. It is the source of truth for `CoinSelector` and for `AssetId` typing. Feeds are **not** started for all supported assets — only for the user's enabled set.

```typescript
export const SUPPORTED_ASSETS = ['bitcoin', 'ethereum', 'solana', 'cardano'] as const;
export const MANDATORY_ASSET: AssetId = 'bitcoin'; // always tracked, cannot be disabled
export const DEFAULT_ENABLED_ASSETS: AssetId[] = ['bitcoin']; // default on first load
```

`enabledAssets` (`src/lib/enabled-assets.ts`) is a persisted Svelte store holding the user's active coin selection. `toggleAsset(id)` adds or removes a coin (bitcoin is guarded). When a coin is disabled, its `disabledAt` timestamp is written to `STORAGE_KEYS.disabledAt`. On app startup, `getExpiredDisabledAssets()` returns coins disabled for longer than `DISABLED_ASSET_PRUNE_AFTER_MS` (3 days); `pruneAssets` / `pruneCandles` / `pruneVolumes` drop their data; `clearExpiredDisabledAt` cleans up the map. If the user re-enables a coin within the grace period, all persisted history is still intact.

**Feed reconnection:** `App.svelte` subscribes to `enabledAssets` after mount. Each time the set changes, it tears down the existing price and kline feeds and starts new ones with the updated list. Only newly added coins trigger a `backfillAll` call. This means with ~100 supported coins the app only streams data for the handful the user has enabled.

---

## Price Provider

The live price WebSocket source is selected by `PRICE_PROVIDER` in `config.ts`:

```typescript
export const PRICE_PROVIDER: 'coincap' | 'binance' = 'binance';
```

| Value | Class | Stream |
|---|---|---|
| `'binance'` | `BinancePriceFeed` (`binance-price.ts`) | `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/stream?streams=...@miniTicker` |
| `'coincap'` | `PriceFeed` (`websocket.ts`) | `wss://ws.coincap.io/prices?assets=...` |

`App.svelte` calls `createPriceFeed()` at startup, which reads `PRICE_PROVIDER` and instantiates the right class. Both implement the `PriceProvider` interface (`provider.ts`). To add a new provider, implement `PriceProvider`, add it to the union type in `config.ts`, and add a branch in `createPriceFeed()`.

CoinCap API key support is planned for a future version — do not implement it yet.

## Coding Conventions

- Every source file must begin with the copyright header, followed by a blank line before the first line of code:
  - `.ts` files: `// Copyright (c) Jeremías Casteglione <jrmsdev@gmail.com>` / `// See LICENSE file.`
  - `.svelte` files: `<!-- Copyright (c) Jeremías Casteglione <jrmsdev@gmail.com> -->` / `<!-- See LICENSE file. -->`
- TypeScript strict mode — no `any`, no implicit types
- Prefer named exports over default exports in `.ts` files
- Svelte components use `<script lang="ts">`
- WebSocket connections must handle reconnection automatically (exponential backoff, capped at 30s)
- Keep business logic (alerts, indicators, WebSocket) in `src/lib/`, not inside components
- One responsibility per file — don't mix WebSocket logic with indicator math
- Unit tests and component tests live alongside source files as `*.test.ts`. Framework: Vitest v2 (jsdom) for lib tests; `@testing-library/svelte` for component tests. Global setup in `src/test-setup.ts`; jest-dom type augmentation in `src/vitest-matchers.d.ts`.
- jsdom has no `WebSocket`. Any test that renders `App.svelte` (or any component that calls `new WebSocket`) must stub it with `vi.stubGlobal('WebSocket', MockWebSocket)` in `beforeAll` and restore with `vi.unstubAllGlobals()` in `afterAll`. See `src/App.test.ts` for the reference implementation.
- Vite `define` globals (`__APP_VERSION__`, `__APP_BUILD__`, `__APP_CDN__`) are declared in `vite.config.ts` and typed in `src/vite-env.d.ts`. Vitest does **not** inherit `vite.config.ts` — the same globals must also be declared in the `define` block of `vitest.config.ts` (use neutral test values: version/build `'test'`, CDN `'/'`). Whenever a new `define` entry is added to `vite.config.ts`, add a matching entry to `vitest.config.ts` or tests that render any component using that global will throw `ReferenceError` at runtime.
- Persisted state in `localStorage` must be versioned (see `STORAGE_KEYS` in `config.ts`) — bump the version key rather than mutating an existing schema

---

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server (HMR). Service worker is NOT registered in dev.
- `npm run check` — `svelte-check` over `.ts` and `.svelte` files; must pass with 0 errors.
- `npm run build` — runs `svelte-check` then `vite build` → `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` — serve `dist/` locally to test the production bundle + service worker.
- `npm test` — run the Vitest unit test suite once (CI mode, no watch).
- `npm run test:watch` — run Vitest in watch mode during development.
- `make check` — shell/python lint of repo-level scripts (shellcheck on `docker/*.sh`, `py_compile` on `upgrade.py`).
- `make ci-check` — what CI runs: `make check` + `npm ci` + `npm run check` + `npm run test` + `npm run build`. Run this locally before opening a PR if you want to mirror CI exactly.

## CI / Release

Two workflows live in `.github/workflows/`:

- **`check.yml`** — runs `make ci-check` on every push to `main` and on every PR targeting `main`. This is the gate for merges.
- **`deploy.yml`** — builds and deploys to GitHub Pages. Triggers ONLY on pushes of a tag matching `release/<version>`, where `<version>` is `x.y`, `x.y.z`, or `x.y.z-n` (e.g. `release/0.1`, `release/1.2.3`, `release/1.2.3-4`). A non-matching tag/ref fails in the `validate` job before any build work. `workflow_dispatch` is retained as a manual escape hatch but also runs through `validate`.

Releasing:

```sh
git tag release/0.1.0
git push origin release/0.1.0
```

The repo's Pages source must be set to **Source: GitHub Actions** for the deploy to succeed. Do NOT add a `release/*` branch trigger — releases are tag-driven; branches named `release/*` are not special.

**CDN split:** The `Make Dist` step passes `TAYRAX_CDN` (read from a GitHub Actions repository variable of the same name) to `vite build` as the `base` URL. When set, all built asset URLs (`<script>`, `<link>`, images) become absolute to that CDN origin while the HTML page files are uploaded to GitHub Pages at their normal paths. If `TAYRAX_CDN` is unset the build falls back to `/` (current behaviour). In dev mode the default is `http://localhost:5173/`. To activate, add a repository variable `TAYRAX_CDN` under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**.

## Maintaining CLAUDE.md

Keep this file up to date. Whenever you make a change that affects project structure, tooling, conventions, or environment setup, update the relevant section. If no section fits, add one.

Whenever a deliberate UI layout or interaction decision is made (badge order, navigation behaviour, modal patterns, etc.), add or update an entry in `## UI Conventions` explaining the rule and the reason behind it.

---

## User-facing documentation

Any behavior that affects how the user perceives the app — update frequency, warm-up periods, limitations, badge meanings — must be documented in two places:

1. **`README.md`** — the `## Notes` section, one sub-heading per topic.
2. **Help page** — the `<dl>` inside `src/Help.svelte` (served at `/help/`).

Both must stay in sync. When you add, change, or remove a documented behavior, update both. Never write to one without checking the other.

**Tone:** Help entries are written for users, not developers. Avoid internal names (`WebSocket`, `REST`, `klines`, `miniTicker`, candle counts, signal period math). Explain what the user will observe and why, not how it is implemented. `README.md` Notes may be more technical since developers also read it, but Help.svelte must stay user-friendly.

---

## Single-page app — view switching

The app is a single HTML entry point (`index.html`). `App.svelte` is the permanent shell: it owns the header, all core logic (feeds, alerts, proposals), and a `currentView` variable that controls which view is rendered in the content area.

| View | Component | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `'dashboard'` | inline in `App.svelte` | Main trading dashboard (default) |
| `'logs'` | `src/Logs.svelte` | Action-log viewer: reverse-chrono list of bot actions |
| `'system'` | `src/System.svelte` | Diagnostic page: browser capabilities + live WebSocket tests |

`NavMenu.svelte` dispatches a `navigate` event with the target view name; `App.svelte` handles it by setting `currentView`. The URL does not change on navigation — there is no router.

Help is a modal overlay (`showHelp` boolean in `App.svelte`). The `?` button in the header toggles it; clicking the backdrop or the close button dismisses it. `Help.svelte` renders only its content section — `App.svelte` provides the modal wrapper.

When adding a new view, create its component under `src/`, add it to the `currentView` union type in `App.svelte`, add a branch to the view switch in the template, and add its entry to `NavMenu.svelte`'s `items` array.

---

## Action Logging

Any action the app or bot takes that is meaningful to the user must be recorded via `logAction` in `src/lib/logs.ts`. Current logged action: alert dispatched. Future actions to log as they are implemented include (but are not limited to): trade proposed, trade confirmed, trade executed, trade cancelled, order placed, order filled, signal triggered.

Rules:
- Call `logAction` at the point where the action is taken, not after the fact.
- Every new action kind requires a new entry in the `LogKind` union in `src/lib/logs.ts`. The TypeScript compiler will then flag every render site that is missing a case (e.g. `KIND_LABEL` in `Logs.svelte`) — fix all flagged sites before committing.
- Do not log routine data updates (price ticks, candle closes) — only log discrete decisions or outputs the user would care to audit.
- Trade proposals (`tradeProposed`) are generated in `src/lib/proposals.ts` and logged via `logAction`. They are driven by indicator signals (RSI, MACD, BB) evaluated across all `CANDLE_INTERVALS`, and subject to `PROPOSAL_COOLDOWN_MS` per asset+interval+signal to avoid flooding the log. The `interval` is included in the log entry's `data` field and displayed as a badge in `Logs.svelte`.

---

## Known Behaviors

- **Volume-spike alerts** require ≥10 closed 1m candles (~10 minutes of uptime) before they can fire. Only 1m candles are routed to the volume store — `applyCandle` in `App.svelte` is guarded by `candle.interval === '1m'`. Baseline is the median of prior closed-candle base volumes from the Binance kline stream. Don't "fix" the warm-up by lowering the sample threshold — it exists to avoid false positives from a cold history.
- **CoinCap tick throttle** — `applyTick` in `prices.ts` silently drops ticks that arrive within `PRICE_TICK_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` (default 5s) of the last accepted tick for the same asset. The first tick for a new asset always passes. Tune the constant in `config.ts`; don't lower it below 1s without a clear reason.
- **WebSocket reconnect backoff** — `reconnectAttempts` is only reset when a connection has been open for ≥10 s (`STABLE_CONNECTION_MS` in `websocket.ts`, `binance-price.ts`, and `binance.ts`). This prevents the backoff from being nullified when a server accepts the handshake but then immediately closes the connection (e.g. Origin rejection from a new deploy domain).
- **Action log ring buffer** — `logAction` in `src/lib/logs.ts` caps the stored entry list at `LOG_MAX_ENTRIES` (500, in `config.ts`). New entries are prepended so the store is always reverse-chronological. Persisted under `STORAGE_KEYS.logs` (`tayrax.logs.v1`); open tabs stay in sync via a module-level `storage` event listener. When adding a new action type, extend the `LogKind` union in `logs.ts` — the compiler will then flag every render site that hasn't been updated (e.g. `KIND_LABEL` in `Logs.svelte`).
- **Multi-interval candle stores** — `candleStores` in `src/lib/candles.ts` is a `Record<CandleInterval, Readable<CandleMap>>` with one independent Svelte store per interval (`1m`, `15m`, `1h`, `4h`, `1d`). Each store has its own `localStorage` key (see `CANDLE_STORAGE_KEYS` in `config.ts`). `applyClosedCandle(interval, candle)`, `prependCandles(interval, asset, historical)`, and `pruneCandles(toRemove)` (which prunes all intervals) are the public API. Alerts use the candle store for their own `interval` field. Proposals are evaluated across all intervals (`CANDLE_INTERVALS` loop in `App.svelte`). The chart has a per-component interval selector.
- **Candle history backfill** — On startup `backfillAll` in `src/lib/backfill.ts` fetches up to `CANDLE_HISTORY_MAX` (200) candles per asset per interval from the Binance REST API, iterating intervals sequentially with a 300 ms gap between each to avoid rate-limit issues. Failures are swallowed. Live candles (from `BinanceKlineFeed`) always win over historical candles when the same `openTime` exists.
- **Indicator warm-up** — Indicators are null until their minimum candle counts are met: SMA(n) / EMA(n) / BB(n) need n candles; RSI(14) needs 15; MACD(12,26,9) needs 34 (26 + 9 − 1). With a successful backfill these are met immediately at load time. Indicator-based alert rules return null (skip) when the required data isn't available yet — they do not fire false positives on insufficient history. Note: alert/proposal logic always uses fixed canonical defaults; only the chart overlays use user-configured periods.
- **Chart indicator settings** — `Chart.svelte` exposes a ⚙ toggle in the header that reveals an inline settings panel with number inputs for SMA fast/slow, EMA fast/slow, BB period/stddev, RSI period, and MACD fast/slow/signal. Settings are per-component-instance and not persisted (reset on page reload). Alerts and proposals are unaffected.
- **Candle deduplication** — `applyClosedCandle` deduplicates by `openTime` (new candle wins). `prependCandles` also deduplicates, with existing (live) candles winning over historical ones. Both trim the result to `CANDLE_HISTORY_MAX` entries, keeping the most recent.
- **Disabled-asset grace period** — When a coin is toggled off, its `disabledAt` timestamp is stored under `STORAGE_KEYS.disabledAt`. Persisted price/candle data is kept for `DISABLED_ASSET_PRUNE_AFTER_MS` (3 days). On the next app startup after that window, `getExpiredDisabledAssets()` identifies expired entries and `pruneAssets` / `pruneCandles` / `pruneVolumes` / `clearExpiredDisabledAt` remove them. Re-enabling within 3 days recovers all history instantly without a new backfill.
- **SW update check** — `watchForUpdates(registration)` in `src/lib/sw-update.ts` is called from `main.ts` (PROD only) after the SW registers. It polls `registration.update()` every `SW_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS` (30 minutes) and listens for `updatefound` → `statechange === 'installed'`. The `updateWaiting` readable store is set to `true` only when `navigator.serviceWorker.controller` is non-null (i.e. this is an upgrade, not the first install). `App.svelte` renders an **update** pill badge in the header when the store is true; clicking it calls `applyUpdate()`, which posts `'SKIP_WAITING'` to the waiting SW and reloads on `controllerchange`. Do not add `self.skipWaiting()` back to the `install` handler in `sw.js` — it would bypass the waiting state and make the badge impossible.

---

## Tool Use

- Prefer `Grep`, `Glob`, and `Read` directly for targeted searches — do not spawn subagents just to look something up
- Only use the `Agent` tool when the task genuinely requires unpredictable multi-step exploration (3+ search rounds that depend on each other)
- Subagent sessions multiply token costs; the default should always be direct tools first

---

## UI Conventions

- **Header badge order** — badges in the `.right` header cluster grow leftward. Stable anchors (`open`/`closed` status, `?` help button) stay rightmost so their positions never shift. Conditional badges (e.g. `update`) are inserted to the left of the status badge. Do not reorder them to put conditional badges after the status badge.
- **Chart settings panel** — the ⚙ button in the chart header controls row toggles an inline `settings-panel` div between the header and the SVG. It is always the last item in the controls row, separated by a `.sep` spacer. Settings are per-component-instance (not persisted) and affect only the chart's visual overlays — not alerts or proposals.

---

## What to Avoid

- Do not add a backend or server — this is a pure client-side app
- Do not introduce a CSS framework (Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.) — plain CSS only
- Do not use `any` in TypeScript
- Do not store sensitive data (API keys, secrets) in localStorage without encryption — flag it and ask
- Do not jump ahead to a later phase feature without finishing the current phase
- Do not add dependencies without a clear reason — keep the bundle lean
- Do not upgrade Vitest beyond v2.x — Vitest v3+ bundles its own Vite 6+, which conflicts with `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte@3` (Svelte 4 / Vite 5) and produces deprecation warnings. Upgrade Vitest only when Svelte and Vite are also being upgraded.
