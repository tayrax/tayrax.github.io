# CLAUDE.md — tayrax

Guidelines for working on this project. Read `docs/tayrax.md` for the full product plan.

---

## Project Overview

**tayrax** is a crypto monitoring and trading assistant PWA.
- Real-time price data via WebSocket (CoinCap, Binance)
- Background market data via REST (CoinGecko)
- No backend — runs entirely in the browser
- Hosted at `tayrax.github.io`

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Framework:** Svelte + Vite
- **App type:** PWA (Service Worker + Web App Manifest)
- **Styling:** plain CSS or CSS custom properties — no UI framework, no Tailwind

Note: `static/` is Vite's `publicDir`. All files here are served from the site
root (`/manifest.json`, `/sw.js`, `/tayrax-logo.svg`). Do not create a separate
`public/` directory — keep PWA assets and logos together in `static/`.

---

## Development Phases

The project is built incrementally. Do not implement features from a later phase until the current one is complete and stable.

1. **Phase 1 — Simple Alerts:** live prices + user-defined alert rules + browser notifications
2. **Phase 2 — Technical Indicators:** OHLCV charts, RSI/SMA/MACD/Bollinger Bands, signal alerts
3. **Phase 3 — Semi-Automatic Trading:** exchange API integration, bot proposes trades, user confirms
4. **Phase 4 — Fully Automatic Trading:** autonomous execution, paper trading mode, risk management

---

## APIs

| API | Usage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CoinCap WebSocket | Real-time prices | `wss://ws.coincap.io/prices?assets=...` |
| Binance WebSocket | Candlesticks, order book | `wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/...` |
| CoinGecko REST | Asset list, market cap, history | 50 req/min on free key |

- Both CoinCap and Binance allow direct browser requests (CORS is open for public endpoints)
- No proxy or backend needed for public market data
- For Phase 3+, exchange API keys must **never** be hardcoded or committed to git

---

## Asset Configuration

Monitored assets are defined as a single configurable list. No per-coin implementation is needed.

```typescript
const MONITORED_ASSETS = ['bitcoin', 'ethereum', 'solana', 'cardano'];
```

---

## Coding Conventions

- Every source file must begin with the copyright header, followed by a blank line before the first line of code:
  - `.ts` files: `// Copyright (c) Jeremías Casteglione <jrmsdev@gmail.com>` / `// See LICENSE file.`
  - `.svelte` files: `<!-- Copyright (c) Jeremías Casteglione <jrmsdev@gmail.com> -->` / `<!-- See LICENSE file. -->`
- TypeScript strict mode — no `any`, no implicit types
- Prefer named exports over default exports in `.ts` files
- Svelte components use `<script lang="ts">`
- WebSocket connections must handle reconnection automatically (exponential backoff, capped at 30s)
- Keep business logic (alerts, indicators, WebSocket) in `src/lib/`, not inside components
- One responsibility per file — don't mix WebSocket logic with indicator math
- Unit tests and component tests live alongside source files as `*.test.ts`. Framework: Vitest v2 (jsdom) for lib tests; `@testing-library/svelte` for component tests. Global setup in `src/test-setup.ts`; jest-dom type augmentation in `src/vitest-matchers.d.ts`.
- jsdom has no `WebSocket`. Any test that renders `App.svelte` (or any component that calls `new WebSocket`) must stub it with `vi.stubGlobal('WebSocket', MockWebSocket)` in `beforeAll` and restore with `vi.unstubAllGlobals()` in `afterAll`. See `src/App.test.ts` for the reference implementation.
- Persisted state in `localStorage` must be versioned (see `STORAGE_KEYS` in `config.ts`) — bump the version key rather than mutating an existing schema

---

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server (HMR). Service worker is NOT registered in dev.
- `npm run check` — `svelte-check` over `.ts` and `.svelte` files; must pass with 0 errors.
- `npm run build` — runs `svelte-check` then `vite build` → `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` — serve `dist/` locally to test the production bundle + service worker.
- `npm test` — run the Vitest unit test suite once (CI mode, no watch).
- `npm run test:watch` — run Vitest in watch mode during development.
- `make check` — shell/python lint of repo-level scripts (shellcheck on `docker/*.sh`, `py_compile` on `upgrade.py`).
- `make ci-check` — what CI runs: `make check` + `npm ci` + `npm run check` + `npm run test` + `npm run build`. Run this locally before opening a PR if you want to mirror CI exactly.

## CI / Release

Two workflows live in `.github/workflows/`:

- **`check.yml`** — runs `make ci-check` on every push to `main` and on every PR targeting `main`. This is the gate for merges.
- **`deploy.yml`** — builds and deploys to GitHub Pages. Triggers ONLY on pushes of a tag matching `release/<version>`, where `<version>` is `x.y`, `x.y.z`, or `x.y.z-n` (e.g. `release/0.1`, `release/1.2.3`, `release/1.2.3-4`). A non-matching tag/ref fails in the `validate` job before any build work. `workflow_dispatch` is retained as a manual escape hatch but also runs through `validate`.

Releasing:

```sh
git tag release/0.1.0
git push origin release/0.1.0
```

The repo's Pages source must be set to **Source: GitHub Actions** for the deploy to succeed. Do NOT add a `release/*` branch trigger — releases are tag-driven; branches named `release/*` are not special.

## Maintaining CLAUDE.md

Keep this file up to date. Whenever you make a change that affects project structure, tooling, conventions, or environment setup, update the relevant section. If no section fits, add one.

---

## Known Behaviors

- **Volume-spike alerts** require ≥10 closed 1m candles (~10 minutes of uptime) before they can fire. Baseline is the median of prior closed-candle base volumes from the Binance kline stream. Don't "fix" the warm-up by lowering the sample threshold — it exists to avoid false positives from a cold history.

---

## What to Avoid

- Do not add a backend or server — this is a pure client-side app
- Do not introduce a CSS framework (Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.) — plain CSS only
- Do not use `any` in TypeScript
- Do not store sensitive data (API keys, secrets) in localStorage without encryption — flag it and ask
- Do not jump ahead to a later phase feature without finishing the current phase
- Do not add dependencies without a clear reason — keep the bundle lean
- Do not upgrade Vitest beyond v2.x — Vitest v3+ bundles its own Vite 6+, which conflicts with `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte@3` (Svelte 4 / Vite 5) and produces deprecation warnings. Upgrade Vitest only when Svelte and Vite are also being upgraded.
